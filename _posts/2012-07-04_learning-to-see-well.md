I met with a thoughtful young lady recently who wanted to talk about a bad night with alcohol. She went out with friends never intending to drink (she was underage), but the desire to fit in drove her to have one, and then another, and so on - a familiar campus script. The night ended in sickness and shame.

In our meeting, she was determined for me to know that she was really a good person. By good, she meant that she generally did the right things, worked hard in school, was well-mannered, and had never sold a kidney on the black market. I asked her what made her want to be so good and she fumbled around for an answer, eventually settling on her desire to make her friends and family proud.

Her “good-person construct” was her ticket to love and acceptance.

At that moment, a light came on for her.

She saw herself more clearly.

The same motive that drove her to make straight A’s in class had caused her courage to fail at a party.

Her problem was more than a bad night; it was a disordered heart.

She lived to please everyone around her, to try and cover up her flaws and feelings of inadequacy with report cards, religious duties, and an active social life.

Flannery O’Connor wrote a short story called, “The Turkey.” In the story, a boy becomes enamored with catching a turkey in order to make his dad proud of him. At one point during the chase, he tears his shirt, and O’Connor writes, “If he came in with a turkey, they wouldn’t pay any attention to his shirt.” This is the rule by which many of us live: “If I can only achieve this, no one will notice how torn up I really am.” Just like Adam clumsily fitting together fig leaves in the Garden, we long for something to cover our shame, something to make us feel whole.

Sometimes we reach for a drink.

Other times we record a new line on our resumes.

Jesus repeatedly said that we need eyes to see, but eyes to see what exactly? We need eyes to see the distortions in us and around us that are allowed to pass as normal. We need vision to see below the surface of our behaviors to the poverty of our hearts. As O’Connor wrote in another place, “Redemption is meaningless unless there is cause for it in the actual life we live....” If we lack the vision to see and name our sin, to see the farce behind our “good-person constructs,” then we’ll also lack the vision to see and name Jesus as our Redeemer.

The good news of the Gospel is that God has provided a better covering than alcohol, resumes, turkeys, or fig leaves. He has provided Jesus, the One who has won for us the eternal satisfaction of the Father and put an end to all our shame. This is the love we have been invited to live in and cultivate. It's the grace given to free us and form us. May we have eyes to see.
