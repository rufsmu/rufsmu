Welcome to SMU RUF. In short, we are a community that is: animated by the gospel, growing together in grace, respecting each individual, loving and serving our campus.

To describe what we mean in a little more detail: The gospel is the good news that God is making all things new through the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus Christ. This transformation is gracious in appearance and cosmic in scope. It brings healing to the broken, pardon to the rebellious, and confidence to the ashamed. Even more, it animates us to love God, love others, and love God’s world. We intend for the gospel to shape all that we are and to set the course for all that we do. The gospel gives birth to a new family. God’s family is not defined by race, class, success, appearance, or utility, but by God’s grace and God’s mission.

At RUF, we intend to be a community who cares for one another, welcomes outsiders, invests in our common life, and celebrates often. Ministry is not the job of religious professionals. Rather, it is the calling of the entire Christian community to love others by what they say and how they live. Most ministry takes place in the ordinary business of the world, or in our case, the day-in and day-out of campus life. It involves challenging individual, ideas, and institutions with the claim that Jesus is Lord, affirming truth, beauty, and justice wherever they are found, and seeking the conditions for our neighbors to flourish. We intend to live faithfully in our calling to love SMU.



> "Anyone can come.. Christ asks no preparation of any kind whatsoever, legal or evangelical, outward or inward, in the coming sinner.... It is not 'exercised souls,' nor 'penitent believers,' nor 'well-humbled seekers,' nor earnest 'users of the means,' nor any of the better class of Adam's sons or daughters: but sinners, that Christ welcomes."
