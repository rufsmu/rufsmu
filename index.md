> "Anyone can come.. Christ asks no preparation of any kind whatsoever, legal or evangelical, outward or inward, in the coming sinner.... It is not 'exercised souls,' nor 'penitent believers,' nor 'well-humbled seekers,' nor earnest 'users of the means,' nor any of the better class of Adam's sons or daughters: but sinners, that Christ welcomes."

## RUF Large Group

Our&nbsp;**Large Group**&nbsp;for the semester begins on&nbsp;**Tuesday, August 26, 7:30 pm, in the Varsity**&nbsp;(the bottom of Hughes-Trigg). Large Group is our weekly meeting where we gather for teaching, singing, prayer, and fellowship. Whether you&#39;re new to campus or you&#39;ve been around a few years, come join us.

We believe the Gospel is the true story of who God is, who we are, and how we fit into God&#39;s world. We also believe that the Bible speaks directly to our deepest longings and most genuine experiences. Perhaps in no area is this more on display than in the area of sexuality. Novelist Bruce Marshall once said, &quot;The young man who rings the bell at the brothel is unconsciously looking for God.&quot; Are spirituality and sexuality really so deeply intertwined? Can the Bible&#39;s &quot;archaic&quot; stories and stances still meaningfully answer this question in our modern world? Come find out for yourself.&nbsp;
