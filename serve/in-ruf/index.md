### Large Group

Large Group is our weekly meeting where we gather for teaching, singing, and prayer. We meet on Tuesday nights from 7:30-8:30, and students hang around after for food and fellowship. We need students to help set up, welcome guests, store our equipment, rearrange chairs, and serve refreshments. If you would like to help in any of these areas once-a-month, please let us know.

### Leadership Team

The RUF Leadership Team is a community of juniors and seniors from all areas of campus life committed to growing together in a love for God, one another, and God&rsquo;s world. We meet once a week for prayer, vision, training, and fellowship. Each member is responsible for serving both inside and outside of RUF.

### Small Group Leadership

Relationships are the context in which God works to transform us, and so small groups are essential to our ministry on campus. We are committed to training students who can reach out and lead small, gospel-centered communities all over campus.
