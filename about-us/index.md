Reformed University Fellowship is the campus ministry of the Presbyterian Church in America (PCA). However, students from all types of religious backgrounds are involved in RUF.  You are welcome to join us whether you are convinced of the historical claims of Christianity or remain unconvinced.

### What's with the name?

I know it seems like a strange choice, but the letters "RUF" communicate our identity well.

### Reformed

"Reformed" refers to a biblical and historical understanding of Christianity as expressed in the Protestant Reformation.  We work from the conviction that the Bible is true, accessible, and God's revelation of Himself. Within RUF you have the freedom to wrestle with God's Word and witness God's work.

### University

RUF aims to be a ministry for the campus, not simply a ministry on the campus.  Our intention is to encourage your faith and calling as you understand the glory of God in Jesus Christ.

### Fellowship

We believe that God created us for relationships, and yet, because of sin we experience alienation from God and one another.  We also believe that the gospel is properly understood within a community of people who, although broken, long to trust and depend on each other.  RUF cultivates community through our campus fellowship, which extends off campus and into the local church.
