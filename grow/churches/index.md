Below are three of the closest churches that sponsor RUF @ SMU. &nbsp;We know there are other great, gospel-centered churches in Dallas. But these three are members of our family.

### Park Cities Presbyterian Church (PCPC)

PCPC is RUF&#39;s &quot;mother&quot; church, having started RUF @ SMU 20 years ago. &nbsp;It&#39;s our largest sponsoring church, as well as the closest to campus. &nbsp;PCPC has a rich tradition of loving college students from SMU. The senior pastor, Mark Davis, was formerly a youth pastor for two decades. He communicates the gospel clearly and persuasively to students.

### Providence Presbyterian Church

Providence Presbyterian Church was planted by former SMU campus minister David Rea about 9 years ago, targeting the north Dallas community of Preston Hollow. &nbsp;David was an RUF campus minister for 8 years, and so understands well the struggles of campus life. Providence families have been involved in hosting RUF events, employing RUF students, and prayerfully supporting our work on campus.

**Sunday Worship Time:** 10:10 am  
**Location:** 10727 Midway Road, Dallas, TX 75229

### New St. Peter&#39;s Presbyterian Church

New St. Peter&#39;s was planted by former RUF campus minister Rich Lambert about 8 years ago, targeting the east Dallas communities of Lakewood and Lake Highlands. New St. Peters has office space across from the Bush Library in the SMU building, which is where some of our RUF staff go to pray, study, and work. The senior pastor is Colin Peters.
