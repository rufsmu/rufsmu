Every Thursday morning we meet at 8:30 am in the Hughes-Trigg student center to pray for our students and our campus. Our prayer time lasts about 45 minutes, and includes a reading from the psalms, the Apostles' Creed (an ancient profession of the Christian faith), shared requests, and corporate prayer. Â Everyone is welcome.

If you have a specific request, please [email us](mailto:james.madden@ruf.org) and our staff will pray for you.
